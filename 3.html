      <h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2>
    </div>
    <article>
      <p>
        Over the course of a year, The Post and ProPublica spoke with dozens of
        Glades residents, teachers, custodians, doctors, nurses and field
        workers about their experiences with cane burning. Some responded to
        automated text messages sent when the newsrooms’ monitors detected
        spikes in pollution, allowing residents to share descriptions of smoke
        and their reactions in real time.
        <br />
        Many of these accounts paint a picture of a community often left with
        little choice but to stay indoors to avoid the smoke and ash outside.
      </p>

      <button class="accordion">
        How many people is living in the area suffering from Black Snow in
        Florida?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Approximately 31,000 people live in the towns that dot the Glades, an
          agricultural region in Florida defined by its vast cane fields that
          produce more than half the nation’s cane sugar.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">
        When does the Black Snow happen in a year?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Nearly every day during the winter and spring, sugar companies set
          fire to dozens of cane fields across western Palm Beach County.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">How long does each burn last?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Each burn lasted less than an hour, but an average of 25 fields were
          burned every day in the four months analyzed by The Palm Beach Post
          and ProPublica.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">
        Why did the state and federal framework for measuring air quality fail
        to capture the impact of sugar cane burning?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Because federal regulators rely on 24-hour and annual averages to
          track a type of particulate matter — an inhalable mixture of
          pollutants and debris tied to heart and lung disease — that is emitted
          by cane burning. These averages sometimes obscure short-term
          pollution, a defining feature of Florida’s harvesting process.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">
        What and how did The Post and ProPublica investigate about Black Snow.
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The reporters analyzed cane burn permits and plume data from the
          Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which
          projected where smoke would travel. They also worked closely with six
          experts in air-quality and public health from universities across the
          country, including three in Florida, as well as with residents, to
          place outdoor air sensors that measured particulate matter. The
          measurements were not intended to assess compliance with the Clean Air
          Act. Rather, the goal was to see if residents were being exposed to
          pollutants in ways that current monitoring systems would miss.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">
        What is the result of the investigation?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The sensors captured repeated spikes in pollution on days when the
          state authorized cane burning and projected that the smoke would blow
          toward them, our analysis found. While particulate matter can come
          from a variety of sources, air monitoring experts said the findings
          suggest the pollution is likely coming from cane burns. These
          short-term spikes, lasting less than an hour, often reached four times
          the average pollution levels in the area. Health and air-quality
          experts added that this exposure poses health risks both in the short
          term and over the course of the months-long burn season.
